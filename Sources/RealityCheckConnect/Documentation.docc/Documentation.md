# ``RealityCheckConnect``

The RealityCheckConnect package provides components for connecting to and managing RealityCheck AR debugging sessions.

This library provides a set of components that enable the establishment of connections with the RealityCheck macOS app for the exchange of AR scene hierarchy and debugging data. It uses the MultipeerConnectivity framework for managing the multipeer session and custom dumping for sending and receiving AR scene data. It can also use ReplayKit to stream the view of a running AR session.

> Tip: A selection of examples, ranging from the simplest to the most challenging stress testing hierarchies, are provided [here](https://github.com/monstar-lab-oss/reality-check/tree/develop/Examples).

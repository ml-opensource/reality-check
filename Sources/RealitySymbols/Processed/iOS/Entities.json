Use anchor entities to control how RealityKit places virtual objects into your scene. ``AnchorEntity`` conforms to the ``HasAnchoring`` protocol, which gives it an ``AnchoringComponent`` instance.  RealityKit places anchors based on the anchoring component’s ``AnchoringComponent\/target-swift.property`` property. For example, you can configure an anchor entity to rest on a detected horizontal surface in an AR scene like a table or floor, and RealityKit automatically places that anchor once it detects an appropriate horizontal plane in the real world.  For information on the different types of anchors available when using Reality Composer, see <doc:selecting-an-anchor-for-a-reality-composer-scene>.  ![Diagram showing the components present in the anchor entity. It contains three boxes labeled Transform component, Synchronization component, and Anchoring component.](AnchorEntity-1)  Add anchor entities directly to your scene’s ``Scene\/anchors`` collection, or anywhere else in the scene hierarchy by adding them to the ``Entity\/children`` collection of another entity in your scene. Because ``AnchorEntity`` is a subclass of ``Entity``, you can make an anchor entity a child of any other entity. RealityKit may move anchor entities as the scene updates, so the location and rotation of the anchor entity may change relative to its parent, even if your code never modifies its ``Entity\/transform`` property.  Some anchor entities may not show up in your scene at all if RealityKit fails to detect an appropriate place for them. For example, an anchor entity with an `image` target won’t show up in the scene until RealityKit detects the specified image in the real world.  ![Block diagram showing how anchor entities attach to a scene, and how they support entity hierarchies. The root box of the hierarchy diagram represents the ARView. It has one child representing the ARView’s scene, and that scene has two children, both of which are anchor entities.

You create and configure entities to embody objects that you want to place in the real world in an AR app. You do this by adding ``Entity`` instances to the ``Scene`` instance associated with an ``ARView``.  RealityKit defines a few concrete subclasses of ``Entity`` that provide commonly used functionality. For example, you typically start by creating an instance of ``AnchorEntity`` to anchor your content, and add the anchor to a scene’s ``Scene\/anchors`` collection. You might then instantiate a ``ModelEntity`` to represent a physical object in the scene, and add that as a child entity to the anchor. You can also create custom entities, and add them either to an anchor, or as children of another entity.  ![Block diagram showing how entity hierarchies, composed of different kinds of entities, attach to a scene, which is itself a child of the AR view.](Entity-1)  You can load predefined entities or a hierarchy of entities from your app’s bundle, or from a file on disk, using the methods in <doc:stored-entities>. Alternatively, you can create entities programmatically.  Entities contain components (instances conforming to the ``Component`` protocol) that provide appearance and behaviors for the entity. For example, the ``Transform`` component contains the scale, rotation, and translation information needed to position an entity in space. You store components in the entity’s ``Entity\/components`` collection, which can hold exactly one of any component type. It makes sense to have only a single ``Transform`` component, one ``ModelComponent`` (specifying the visual appearance of the entity), and so on.  ![Diagram showing the components present in the base entity class, as well as in the derived anchor entity and model entity classes.](Entity-2)  All entities inherit a few common components from the ``Entity`` base class: the ``Transform`` component for spatial positioning, and ``SynchronizationComponent``, which enables synchronization of the entity among networked peers. Specific types of entities define additional behaviors.

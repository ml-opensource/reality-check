This component holds the entity's data related to participating in the scene's physics simulation. It is also used to calculate collision queries, raycasts, and convex shape casts. Entities can participate in the scene simulation in two different modes: as a *rigid body* or as a *trigger*.  A rigid body fully participates in the collision simulation. It affects the velocity and direction of entities it collides. If configured with a rigid body ``RealityKit\/PhysicsBodyComponent\/mode`` of ``RealityKit\/PhysicsBodyMode\/dynamic``, it's own velocity and direction can be affected by other rigid body entities. A trigger entity doesn't have any impact on the rigid bodies in the scene, but can trigger code or Reality Composer behaviors when a rigid body enity overlaps it.  Note the following when considering applying a non-uniform scale to an entity: - Non-uniform scaling is applicable only to box, convex mesh and triangle mesh collision shapes. - Non-uniform scaling is not supported for all other types of collision shapes. In this case the scale.x value is duplicated to the scale's y and z components as well to force scale uniformity based on the x component. - If the entity has a non-uniform scale assigned to its transform then that entity should not have any descendants assigned that contain rotations in their transforms. A good rule of thumb is to assign the non-uniform scale to the entity that has the collision shape, and avoid adding children below that entity.

The `isEnabled` flag can be used to override this behavior by adding the `InputTargetComponent` to a descendant and setting `isEnabled` to false.  `InputTargetComponent`'s `allowedInputTypes` property allows the entity to only receive the provided types of input.

The position and orientation of spatial audio sources are updated continuously and automatically by the audio system, so sounds always come from an entity wherever it goes and wherever it is pointing. Spatial audio sources have the user environment's acoustics applied to them so that they blend in naturally with it, and they are distance attenuated so they become quieter the further away they are from the user.  - Note: Spatial audio sources emit only a single channel (i.e., mono). If the format of the audio resource played on the entity is stereo or multichannel, all of its channels will be mixed down to a single channel before spatialization. To minimize any unwanted mixdown artifacts, use mono source material where possible.  RealityKit audio playback is spatial by default, so no additional configuration is necessary to opt into sophisticated spatial rendering.  ```swift let entity = Entity() let resource = try AudioFileResource.load(named: \"MyAudioFile\") entity.playAudio(resource) \/\/ Audio file is played spatially from entity ```  The `SpatialAudioComponent` allows you to further customize the playback characteristics of spatial audio sources. The `gain`, `directLevel`, and `reverbLevel` properties are in relative Decibels, in the range `-.infinity ... .zero`, where `-.infinity` is silent and `.zero` is nominal.  For example, you can adjust the overall level of all sounds played from the entity with the `gain` property.  ```swift entity.spatialAudio = SpatialAudioComponent(gain: -10) ```  You can reduce the amount of reverb applied to all sounds played from the entity with the `reverbLevel` property. Reducing this value will make the sounds less reverberant and more intimate. Setting `reverbLevel` to `-.infinity` will cause the sounds to collapse into the head of the listener.  ```swift entity.spatialAudio?.reverbLevel = -6 ```  The `gain`, `directLevel`, and `reverbLevel` properties can be updated dynamically, for example based on your app's state, or in the context of a Custom RealityKit System.  The `directivity` property allows you to configure the radiation pattern for sound emitted from the entity.  ```swift entity.spatialAudio?.directivity = .beam(focus: 0.5) ```  Spatial audio sources project sounds along their -Z axis. If a spatial audio source is co-located and co-oriented with visual content authored with a +Z-forward coordinate convention, you will want to rotate your spatial audio source 180º about the Y-axis.  ```swift let parent = Entity()  \/\/ Add model entity let model = try ModelEntity.load(named: \"PositiveZForward\") parent.addChild(model)  \/\/ Add audio source entity let audioSource = Entity() parent.addChild(audioSource)  \/\/ Orient audio source towards +Z audioSource.orientation = .init(angle: .pi, axis: [0, 1, 0]) ```  This is only a consideration if you have explicitly set a `directivity` other than the default `.beam(focus: .zero)`, which projects sound evenly for all frequencies in all directions."},{"properties":[{"complete":"var identifier: UInt64 { get }","name":"identifier","comment":"A unique identifier of an entity within a network session.","type":"UInt64"},{"name":"ownershipTransferMode","type":"SynchronizationComponent.OwnershipTransferMode","complete":"var ownershipTransferMode: SynchronizationComponent.OwnershipTransferMode","comment":"The entity’s transfer ownership mode.

# RealityCheck

| :warning: WARNING          |
|:---------------------------|
| RealityCheck is still in the early stages of development, and many of the planned features have not yet been implemented. We welcome contributions from the AR development community to help us improve and expand the app. Please keep this in mind when using RealityCheck in your projects, and feel free to submit issues or feature requests to our issue tracker. |


**RealityCheck** is an open-source Mac app designed to help AR development teams streamline their workflows and improve the quality of their projects. It provides a debugger for RealityKit, a powerful framework for building AR experiences, that allows developers to inspect the [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/realitykit/implementing-systems-for-entities-in-a-scene) structure and properties, and make changes in real-time for preview/debug purposes.

## Features

- Inspect and modify entity and component properties in real-time for debugging and preview purposes
- Stream the current state of your AR app to the RealityCheck debugger in real-time
- Support for custom representations for different types of properties, such as transform matrices and light intensity
- Built with SwiftUI and [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) for clean, modular code and a great user experience

## Getting Started


To use RealityCheck in your AR project, you'll need to import the RealityCheck library and connect to a live session running on an iOS device. Please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/monstar-lab/reality-check/docs) for detailed instructions on how to integrate RealityCheck into your project.

# RealityCheck

RealityCheck is an open-source Mac app designed to help AR development teams streamline their workflows and improve the quality of their projects. It provides a debugger for RealityKit, a powerful framework for building AR experiences, that allows developers to inspect the Entity Component System (ECS) structure and properties, and make changes in real-time for preview/debug purposes.
